#blink-tag
While I was working on a side-project, I realized that I have re-created the infamous blink-tag of the geocities era.

So here it is in all its beauty.

I also did not bother to create a .gitignore for this "project". So all the dependencies are in this repository, too.

Check out the demo.html for use of the blink-tag.
The blink-tag definition itself exists in elements/blink-tag.html.

The element takes 1 optional attribute:

- iterations (default: "10")

Geocities and the MySpaces of the web and no search engines other than Google have been visited during the development of this project.
